### About AA Tree
It is a type of Red-Black Tree, however, it is simpler than Red-Black Tree.To use *Skew* and *Split*, it can make sure that search tree is not too bad.While an AA tree makes more rotations than a red-black tree, the simpler algorithms tend to be faster, and all of this balances out to result in similar performance. AA trees are named for Arne Andersson, you can search this passage:**Balanced search trees made simple**, which is written by Arne Andersson, their inventor.
