# AA-Tree
Binary Balanced Search Trees. A simple way to make it.    
It is a type of Red-Black Tree, however, it is simpler than Red-Black Tree.To use *Skew* and *Split*, it can make sure that search tree is not too bad.While an AA-tree makes more rotations than a red-black tree, the simpler algorithms tend to be faster, and all of this balances out to result in similar performance. AA-trees are named for Arne Andersson, you can search this passage:**Balanced search trees made simple**, which is written by Arne Andersson, their inventor.
# Why not use Red-Black tree?
None algorithms are best.However, to use AA-Tree, you can make your code simple.As far as I am concerned, may be it will spend more time in roating, but the simpler algorithms tend to be faster. I believe AA-Tree is a simple way to solve search questions.
